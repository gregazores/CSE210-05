# Cycles
Cycles is a clone of the classic arcade game. Two players direct their cycles with ever growing trails left behind.

```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 snake
